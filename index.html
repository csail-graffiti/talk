    <h1>Context</h1>

    In real life things happen in physical places.

    These places may be public and even contain similar people, by space itself.

    When I'm at a bar, I implicitly know the people around me also made a choice to come to the bar
    
    so they've made an implicit 
    so they must be expecting the type of activity associated with bar.

    Even if these places are public, we act differently they can carry different meaning.

    Church and Bar.

    Online things

    Suppose I'm talking to people under the tag "Paddy's Pub" which is associated with the query
    {
      type: "post",
      content: { "$type": "string" },
      tags: "Paddy's Pub"
    }

    Conversation that goes like:


    Now my colleague come's around and look "My Wall" e.g. all the posts by me

    {
      type: "Post",
      _by: [My ID]
    }

      content: "yoooooooooooo let's do shots"
      tags: ["Paddy's Pub"]

    Some recruiter come's





    "at school", "at work".
    Even if places are public, they carry different meaning.

    Online things happen in places too.

    By app: "on twitter", "on facebook"
    By category: "in a channel", "in a forum", "on a subreddit", "on gay TikTok"
    In relation to other places: "in a comments section", "in a thread" "in a folder"
    By identity: "on my wall", "@me"
    By location: "at an event", "in my neighborhood", "in a radius"

    Sometimes things happen in multiple places at once, sometime things are in intersecting places.

    In a system where you can just query for whatever you want, how can I make sure?

      \rant: why I don't use Twitter
    </h1>

    When you interact with twitter, either by commenting or liking something, those actions can be shared with all of your twitter followers.
    I follow a bunch of different people on twitter and if my academic friends interacted with my queer friends that would be fine, but I'm not going out of my way to say "look how gay I am.

    One way that data could be stored is within a hierarchy.
    This comment is *within*

  How does context work
  Not useful if you're all going to be doing stuff at the same time.
  Where do you "put" stuff.
  This is important for the end user.
  Also important for the speaker - people change what they say based on who their audience is.
  Let's say I want to create a band people nearby who are interested in music.
  Often we represent things in hierarchies.
  Is it first people nearby -> people interested in music.
  or people interested in music -> people nearby.

    How does this compare to Solid? ActivityPub?
    (good for talk to people *on your server* and for talking to people who you have specific relationships with. conflates hardware and community.)
    Is this decentralized? Not yet!
    Does that matter?
